ONLISP-CLOJURE
----------------------
A port of selected examples from _On Lisp_ to Clojure.
The purpose of this port is to explore the intersection between
Lisp and Clojure's signature features: access to the JVM and a 
functional programming style base on immutable collections.


WHAT YOU SHOULD DO FIRST
------------------------
Read _On Lisp_. It's great. Buy a copy.

THEN...
----------------------
Get yourself some Clojure (http://clojure.org) and take 
a look at the code in this project.
